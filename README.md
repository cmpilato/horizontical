# horizontical

Python-based image processing tool for ensuring images of the desired size.

## Description

Advances in the technology and habits of photography don't always
track together, with the aspect ratio on the "capture" side being
different from that on the "display" side.  This Python module and
tool implement one particular corrective measure for this situation,
specifically the "blurred background fill" technique.
